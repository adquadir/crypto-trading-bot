# Profit Scraping Engine ATR-Adaptive Fixes Complete

## Overview
Successfully applied surgical fixes to restore profit scraping engine performance by reverting from aggressive ATR-based changes back to the proven working approach with selective improvements.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **Tighter Entry Tolerances** (CRITICAL)
- **Entry tolerance**: Reduced ATR fraction from 0.25 → 0.15
- **Proximity tolerance**: Reduced ATR fraction from 0.50 → 0.30
- **Min/max bounds**: Tightened ranges to prevent late/expensive fills
- **Result**: More precise entries closer to actual support/resistance levels

### 2. **Calmer Step-Trailing System** (MAJOR)
- **Step cooldown**: Increased from 20s → 40s (less whipsaw)
- **Step increment**: Increased from $10 → $15 (bigger steps)
- **Trail cap**: Reduced from $100 → $60 (earlier handoff to ATR)
- **Cap trail multiplier**: Reduced from 0.55 → 0.40 (tighter final trail)
- **Result**: More stable trailing that locks profits without premature exits

### 3. **Softer Confirmation Buffers** (IMPORTANT)
- **CALM regime**: Reduced close buffer from 0.0015 → 0.0012
- **NORMAL regime**: Reduced close buffer from 0.0020 → 0.0015
- **ELEVATED regime**: Reduced close buffer from 0.0025 → 0.0020
- **HIGH regime**: Reduced close buffer from 0.0035 → 0.0030
- **Result**: Less restrictive candle confirmation, allowing more valid entries

### 4. **Relaxed Counter-Trend Strictness** (MODERATE)
- **Strength threshold**: Reduced from 92 → 88 for counter-trend trades
- **Proximity multiplier**: Increased from 0.5 → 0.75 for counter-trend distance
- **Result**: Allows high-quality counter-trend opportunities without being overly restrictive

### 5. **Consistent Rule-Based Targets** (STABILITY)
- Maintained rule-based target calculation (not ATR-aware targets)
- Preserved $18 gross TP, $18 gross SL, $15 gross floor structure
- Kept 10x leverage and $500 position sizing
- **Result**: Consistent, predictable profit targets aligned with system rules

## Technical Implementation

### ATR-Adaptive Framework Preserved
- Kept volatility regime classification (CALM/NORMAL/ELEVATED/HIGH)
- Maintained ATR caching system for performance
- Preserved multi-tolerance system for different use cases
- Enhanced with surgical precision adjustments

### Hybrid Trailing System Enhanced
- **Dollar-based step trailing**: $15 increments with 40s cooldown
- **ATR-based breakeven/trail**: Volatility-aware trailing after cap
- **Cap handoff mechanism**: Smooth transition at $60 profit lock
- **Anti-whipsaw protection**: Hysteresis and timing controls

### Validation Pipeline Optimized
- **Level relevance**: 30-day age limit, 15% distance limit
- **Support/resistance validation**: 50% bounce/rejection rate required
- **Confirmation candles**: Volatility-aware close buffers
- **Trend filtering**: Multi-timeframe analysis with relaxed thresholds

## Expected Performance Improvements

### 1. **Higher Win Rate**
- Tighter entry tolerances → better entry prices
- Softer confirmations → more valid opportunities
- Relaxed counter-trend → captures high-quality reversals

### 2. **Better Profit Retention**
- Calmer step-trailing → less premature exits
- Larger step increments → meaningful profit locks
- Tighter final trail → protects locked gains

### 3. **More Consistent Results**
- Rule-based targets → predictable profit expectations
- Enhanced validation → higher quality setups
- Reduced whipsaw → smoother equity curve
