# 🎯 Frontend-Backend Alignment - COMPLETE

## 📋 Overview

I have successfully updated both frontend pages to properly align with the new profit scraping backend system. The frontend now correctly reflects the separation between virtual testing and real trading.

## 🔄 What Was Fixed

### ❌ **Previous Issues:**
- Paper Trading page showed outdated "take profit/stop loss" from old logic
- Frontend didn't reflect the new profit scraping strategy integration
- No clear distinction between virtual and real trading
- UI elements didn't match the actual backend flow

### ✅ **Now Fixed:**
- Paper Trading page shows profit scraping strategy with virtual money warnings
- Profit Scraping page has clear real money trading warnings
- UI properly reflects the magnet level detection system
- Frontend matches the actual backend architecture

## 📱 Frontend Pages Updated

- **Virtual Indicators**: All displays clearly marked as "Virtual"

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
